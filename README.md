### Created January 14, 2025 by A. McBride ###

This project is intended to be a fully modular version of my DIB kinetic tomography
code, originally written in the directory nanoKT_v1 (and earlier). 

To use this code, run microkt.py with a specified directory for input and output files.
To configure pipeline behavior, include CONFIG.json in specified directory.
Default parameters will be read from DEFAULTS.json.
