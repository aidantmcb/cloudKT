### Created January 14, 2025 by A. McBride ###

This project is intended to be a fully modular version of my DIB kinetic tomography
code, originally written in the directory nanoKT_v1 (and earlier). 

To use this code, run microkt.py.

Default parameters can be found in defaults.txt, which will be read from if inputs are
not given.
